Dependency Injection

Defi:
- There should be no need to create a object of dependency by self
- Instead let the object of your class's object give you that dep object

So now our code base is not dependent on any class

@Autowire in spring boot, this is noting but DI

Benefits:
- It is easier to test, it is easier to test Crow class by providing different flying behaviour.
- Easier to change
